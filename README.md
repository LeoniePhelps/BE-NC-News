## Environment Variables

To successfully connect to the two databases locally, create two environment variable files: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
